# NLP English Project

Welcome to the **NLP English Project**! This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model developed to classify and analyze English language texts with various applications. This project is focused on building a robust NLP pipeline that handles tasks such as sentiment analysis, translation detection, and more.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to apply NLP techniques to analyze and classify English texts. It leverages state-of-the-art NLP models to handle complex language tasks, providing a framework that can be expanded for additional text-based analyses.

### Key Features
- **Translation Detection**: Determines whether a sentence was translated by a machine or a professional translator.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies text into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.
- **Text Preprocessing Pipeline**: Includes cleaning, tokenization, and other essential NLP preprocessing steps.

## Project Structure

- `main.ipynb`: The primary Jupyter notebook containing code and explanations for each step of the NLP pipeline.
- `data/`: This folder contains the datasets used for training and evaluation.
- `models/`: Pretrained and fine-tuned models are saved here for reusability.
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions to assist with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need:
- Python 3.7 or above
- Jupyter Notebook
- The following Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `sklearn`
  - `transformers`
  - `torch`
  - `nltk`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fredsmeds/NLPEnglish.git
   cd NLPEnglish
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook main.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Loading**: Load your dataset into the notebook and prepare it for processing.
2. **Preprocessing**: Run the preprocessing cells to clean and prepare text data.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train the classifier on the processed data and evaluate its performance.
4. **Analysis**: Use the model to analyze and classify new text data.

## Example

Below is an example of how to use the translation detection model:

```python
# Load model and preprocess text
from utils import load_model, preprocess_text

model = load_model("translation_detection_model")
text = "This is an example sentence."
processed_text = preprocess_text(text)

# Run inference
prediction = model.predict([processed_text])
print("Translation Type:", "Professional" if prediction == 1 else "Machine")
```
